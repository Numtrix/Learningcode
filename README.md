# Learningcode
This website is to help deepen the understanding of coding, development and computer science 
Coding, in its simplest form, is giving a computer a set of instructions to follow, written in a language it understands. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, whether it's displaying text, performing calculations, or controlling hardware. For beginners, BASIC, short for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, is a good starting point due to its simple syntax.
