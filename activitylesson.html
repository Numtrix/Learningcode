✅ Lesson Generator Prompt
Create a self-contained instructional lesson for a student project using only GitHub’s web interface (no local git).

Each lesson should:

Have a clear title and an Objective section
Include step-by-step instructions using headings and bullet points
Provide a practice activity that applies the skill
End with reflection questions or a recap
The lesson should fit into a unit focused on building and publishing a website using HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages. Use simple, accurate examples and assume learners are beginners but comfortable with basic web development.

If the lesson involves writing code (e.g., HTML or Markdown), show it in a formatted block.

Optional challenge lessons should be clearly labeled as such and introduce slightly more advanced tasks (e.g., JavaScript, GitHub Projects, Pull Requests).

Example lesson topics:

Creating and linking additional HTML files
Adding images or styling with CSS
Improving README files with Markdown
Creating GitHub issues or using pull requests
Exploring real open-source repositories
